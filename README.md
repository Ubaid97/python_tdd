# Test Driven Development
- TDD helps minimise errors in a product
- python has several modules we can use to test code:
    - pytest
    - unittest

**Steps**
- Create a file to write tests
- Write failing tests
- Write code to make those tests pass
- Write new failing tests...

**Naming conventions for files**
- simple_calc
- test_simple_calc
